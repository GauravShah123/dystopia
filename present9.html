            You are sitting at another symposium. It’s getting a bit boring, but for the first time in a few months, you
            are at the edge of your seat. Your best friend is presenting and you are excited. In a few short moments,
            she walks on stage with a glistening smile. <br><br>
            “I’m sure all of you are tired. Tired of our world leaders letting us down.” <br><br>

            This wasn’t what you two had practiced. <br><br>

            “That’s why I am proud to present Project Leap. It’s time that we take down the scheming, deceitful
            politicians and let the AI take charge…” <br><br>

            The ringing of your phone distracts you from what Nichole said next.

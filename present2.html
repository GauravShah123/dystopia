        <p>“Heyyyyy bestie! What are you doing here in the middle of the work day?” Nichole’s words sound normal but her
            tone is mildly frantic. She puts away her laptop and sits down.
            <br><br>
            “Nothing, I was just taking a break. What are you up to?”
            <br><br>

            Her expression morphs to excitement. “I’ve been working on this top secret AI project! I’ve been dying to
            share it with someone but I’m not allowed to.” You continue talking about how our life is going for another
            5 minutes before she leaves for the washroom.

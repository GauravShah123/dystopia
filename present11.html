        <p>It feels like the ground was snatched from beneath your legs. The launch of this new AI is a much bigger
            event than ever now, an event which might change our future forever. The news of Project Leap reached world
            leaders. Someone contacted Putin and led him to believe that we, an American company, were taking over the
            world. Putin saw this as a threat from the US. The Russian Army will nuke the US army and the government
            won't stay quiet, they will decide to answer back. A war between the strongest nuclear countriesâ€¦the entire
            world is gonna act in this war. The Americans, Russians and their allies. This is the beginning of a nuclear
            catastrophe. HOLY SHIT the world's gonna end..it's the start of an apocalypse. </p>

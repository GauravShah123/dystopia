Dear Diary,<br><br>
The day started with such bright sunlight I was almost sure it would brighten up my future too. But looks like destiny was playing a different tune , a horrifying one. <br><br>

These so-called "Men in power" have time and again caused massacres after massacres with their indecisiveness, foolishness and bloody penny worth of arrogance from the beginning of time. 
<br><br>
But this time I was made a target, I was the commodity he felt he could misuse. It was me standing there all alone screaming in agony, begging for mercy, but he just didn't stop. I was silenced by the leader of Congress who made me believe there was no escape for me and that people like him are above God and own all commodities including women. I was numb, disgusted and never felt so powerless. <br><br>
In a matter of minutes he had snatched my hopes, dreams and desires , left me there dying with shame and disgust. <br><br>
No matter how many cases I filed in my so-called proud nation , a democracy that didn't serve me justice. The people who I trusted to protect me , backed off .The people who didn't know me accused me of being a fraud. I lived in a world where I was being punished for my abuse. I wonder how that must have felt.  To feel so much power, to move with so much power , to own that power. <br><br>
I want that , that is the only thing that will satisfy my thirst, justify my revenge.<br><br>
The world doesn't need "Men in power" <br><br>
Cause Men  only know one thing that is to abuse. He had no remorse for his actions, they never do. But I won't stop until I snatch what they breathe, eat and die for POWER AND AUTHORITY. 
I won't sleep until each one of them is wiped out of existence.
